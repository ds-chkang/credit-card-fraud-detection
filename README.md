# credit-card-fraud-detection-model
This is a demonstration to illustrate how to build a credit card fraud detection model by applying various feature engineering techniques.
Logistic Regression and LightGBM applied.
Scikit-Learn has been applied to build predictive models. 
Models are develope applying the following parts below:

- Part 1. No Data Transformation
- Part 2. Data Normalization
- Part 3. Outlier detection and removal
- Part 4. Data Normalization and Outlier detection and removal
- Part 5. Sampling without Data Normarlization and Outlier detection and removal
- Part 6. Sampling with Data Normalization
- Part 7. Sampling with Data Normalization and Outlier detection and removal
- Part 8. Sampling with Outlier detection and removal
- Part 9. AutoEncoder
